# Heat Templates
Heat is a service to orchestrate multiple composite cloud applications using templates.

### Heat template orchestration guide
https://docs.openstack.org/heat/rocky/template_guide/hot_guide.html

# Heat-stack-workshop
This repository contains templates for use with [OpenStack Heat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat) to deploy openstack resources.

# Pre-requisites

### OpenStack CLI tools

You need to install the following packages: 
python3-openstackclient 
python3-novaclient 
python3-heatclient 
python3-neutronclient 
python-glanceclient

This will provide commands such as `openstack`, `nova`, `heat`, etc.

### An OpenStack account

You need to have access to an OpenStack environment and project which allows
you to:

* Create/delete virtual machines and networks
* Create/run/delete Heat stacks
* Assign floating IP addresses

You will need to have an OPENRC file.  Here is an example, using Keystone V3
auth:
```
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
export OS_AUTH_TYPE=password
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<project_name>
export OS_USERNAME=my-username
export OS_PASSWORD=my-password
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://<URL>:30500/v3
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
export OS_INTERFACE=public
```
### Heat stack deployment

  1. Grab repo from github:
     ```https://github.com/hemantsonawane95/heat-stack-workshop.git```
  2. Now do the changes in the confiugration files accordingly.
     
     The following paramerters must be change:
     * 'flavor' : Put a valid flavor name from openstack
     * 'image'  : A valid image name or ID from openstack
     * 'ssh_key' : ssh key name imported in openstack
     * 'heat_volume_size' : specify the external volume size which needs to be attached to the server
     * 'heat_floating_ip_net' : specify valid floating ip network name
  3. source openrc file using command `source openrc`

Note: The template must be in yaml format and be saved with the .yaml file extension. You should also make sure that you use the correct indentation. 

### Task-1 : Volume creation in openstack using heat-template

The ultimate goal of this task is to create volume in openstack env using heat-template. Use `heat-volume-stack.yaml` template to create volume. 
By running openstack heat command `openstack heat create` will create 10GB size volume in openstack env. It can be verified via openstack cli or in openstack horizon. 

For resizing volume change the default size in `heat-volume-stack.yaml` and then running stack update will resize the volume to updated size.


### Task-2 : Create full resources in openstack 

This task is all about creating resources needed to run a server in openstack env using heat-template. Use `heat-resources-stack.yaml` template to create resources.

This template will create the following and connect them up:
  
  * Instance
  * router
  * port 
  * static ip 
  * floating ip 
  * volume 
  * Instance 
  
**Create an Instance:**

Use the `OS::Nova::Server` resource to create a Compute instance. The `flavor` property is the only mandatory one, but you need to define a boot source using one of the `image` or `block_device_mapping` properties.
You also need to define the networks property to indicate to which networks your instance must connect if multiple networks are available in your tenant.

**Connect an instance to a network:**

Use the networks property of an `OS::Nova::Server` resource to define which networks an instance should connect to. Define each network as a YAML map, containing one of the following keys:

**port:**

The ID of an existing Networking port. You usually create this port in the same template using an `OS::Neutron::Port` resource. You will be able to associate a floating IP to this port, and the port to your Compute instance.

**network:**

The name or ID of an existing network. You donâ€™t need to create an `OS::Neutron::Port` resource if you use this property. But you will not be able to use neutron floating IP association for this instance because there will be no specified port for server.

**Create and associate a floating IP to an instance:**

You can use two sets of resources to create and associate floating IPs to instances.
 
**1. OS::Nova resources:**
    Use the `OS::Nova::FloatingIP` resource to create a floating IP, and the `OS::Nova::FloatingIPAssociation` resource to associate the floating IP to an instance.
 
**2. OS::Neutron resources:**
    Use the `OS::Neutron::FloatingIP` resource to create a floating IP, and the `OS::Neutron::FloatingIPAssociation` resource to associate the floating IP to a port
    we have used this set to create floating ip and attached to instance in this workshop.

**Enable remote access to an instance:**
  The `key_name` attribute of the `OS::Nova::Server` resource defines the key pair to use to enable SSH remote access
  We can also specify `key_name` as parameter same as in `heat-resources-stack.yaml` template or key can be created.

**Create a network and a subnet:**
  Use the `OS::Neutron::Net` resource to create a network, and the `OS::Neutron::Subnet` resource to provide a subnet for this network

**Create and manage a router:** 
  Use the `OS::Neutron::Router` resource to create a router. You can define its gateway with the `external_gateway_info` property
  
**Create a volume:**
  Use the `OS::Cinder::Volume` resource to create a new Block Storage volume. Also we can create it as parameter and use it in resources.

**Attach a volume to an instance:**
  Use the `OS::Cinder::VolumeAttachment` resource to attach a volume to an instance.

### Task-3 : Connect to the instance

  Modify the code written in the previous task so that you are able to connect inside the created server.

### Task-4 : Advanced Heat templates

  In the previous examples, all the resources were declared. When writing complex templates you are encouraged to break up your template into separate smaller templates. These can then be brought together using template resources. This is a mechanism to define a resource using a template, thus composing one logical stack with multiple templates.

  In the `advanced` folder of this repository, we prepared an example how to re-use the same piece of code to create multiple components. 
    openstack stack create -t template/lab.yaml -e env/tcpisek.env <stack-name>

  The goal of this task is to create a resource BasicServer and instanciate this resource several time.
  The `BasicServer` resource is composent of the following parts:
  - a volume created from an image given as a parameter
  - a port created on a subnet given as a parameter
  - a server booting from that volume
  - ... and all the other resources which will allow you to connect to that server using ssh.
